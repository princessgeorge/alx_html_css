#  HTML & CSS Advanced Project

##  Project Overview
This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering Program**.  
It builds on the **HTML Advanced** project by focusing on **CSS styling** and page design.  

The goal is to transform a raw HTML structure into a visually appealing and responsive webpage by implementing styles from the provided **Figma design file**.  

Through this project, I’ll be practicing **front-end development skills** such as layout structuring, typography, spacing, responsiveness, and asset management.


##  Objectives
- Apply **CSS styling** to an existing HTML page.  
- Recreate the design as closely as possible to the **Figma mockup**.  
- Implement **semantic HTML** and maintain accessibility best practices.  
- Organize project assets (fonts, images, CSS) properly for reusability.  
- Understand the connection between **design specifications** and **front-end code**.  



##  Design Resources
- **Figma File:** [ Access Design on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=FEZnpXcx8gMcbpcD-0)  
- **Images & Assets:** [ Download Assets](2d6ece16dd7ab4ed2701047586bc80f0cb68835c)  
- **Fonts Used:**  
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)  
  - [Spin Cycle OT](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/spin-cycle)


## Project Structure
```
alx-html-css-project/
│── index.html        # Main HTML file
│── style.css         # Custom CSS styles
│── assets/           # Folder containing images, fonts, and other assets
│── README.md         # Documentation


## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/princessgeorge/alx_html_css.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd alx_html_css
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the project.  


## Notes
- Some measurements from Figma may appear as **float values** (e.g., `12.8px`). It is acceptable to **round them** (e.g., `13px`).  
- Ensure all **assets** (images, logos, fonts) are linked correctly.  
- The webpage should be **responsive** and align closely with the design specifications.  


## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, I will:
- Gain hands-on experience converting **design prototypes into functional webpages**.  
- Strengthen my knowledge of **CSS layout techniques** (flexbox, grid, positioning).  
- Understand how to **structure projects** for scalability and collaboration.  
- Improve attention to detail when following **design-to-code** requirements.
